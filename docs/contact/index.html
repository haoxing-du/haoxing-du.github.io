    <div class="content"><p>Hi! I&rsquo;m <strong>Haoxing</strong>.
I think a lot about the <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/effective-altruism-an-introduction/" target="_blank">best ways to do good</a>, and I&rsquo;m passionate about helping make sure that the artificial intelligence we develop is safe and beneficial.
Currently, I work on evaluating the capabilities of language models with the <a href="https://evals.alignment.org" target="_blank">Evals team</a> at the <a href="https://alignment.org" target="_blank">Alignment Research Center</a>.
Before this I did some research on neural network interpretability at <a href="https://www.redwoodresearch.org/" target="_blank">Redwood Research</a>.
Check out the work I did on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FF8i6SLfKb4g7C4EL/inside-the-mind-of-a-superhuman-go-model-how-does-leela-zero-2" target="_blank">interpreting Leela Zero</a>, a superhuman Go-playing neural network.</p>
<p>Before getting involved in AI safety I spent some years thinking about physics.
At Berkeley, I did research in the intersection of machine learning and physics in the amazing <a href="http://bnachman.web.cern.ch/bnachman/index.html" target="_blank">Nachman group</a>.
Prior to Berkeley, I was fortunate to be part of the <a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program" target="_blank">Perimeter Scholars International</a> program, and studied at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd College</a>.</p>
<p>In a past life, I thought a lot about the foundations of quantum theory.
Although I&rsquo;m no longer pursuing a career in quantum foundations, I remain passionate about the field, and think that many important, recent ideas in quantum foundations are not being effectively communicated to a wider audience.
I hope this blog helps bridge that gap, and hope that my younger self from undergraduate years would have been inspired if she were to stumble upon such a blog.</p>
