    <div class="content"><p>Hi! I&rsquo;m <strong>Haoxing</strong>.
I&rsquo;m finishing up a master&rsquo;s in physics at UC Berkeley.
Nowadays, I think a lot about the <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/effective-altruism-an-introduction/" target="_blank">best ways to do good</a>, and I&rsquo;m passionate about helping make sure that the artificial intelligence we develop is safe and beneficial. I&rsquo;m doing some research on neural network interpretability at <a href="https://www.redwoodresearch.org/" target="_blank">Redwood Research</a>. Check out this <a href="https://modelbehavior.ngrok.io/" target="_blank">website</a> I made for playing with GPT-2 and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LkBmAGJgZX2tbwGKg/help-out-redwood-research-s-interpretability-team-by-finding" target="_blank">finding algorithmic behaviors</a> in it.</p>
<p>While at Berkeley, I did research in the intersection of machine learning and physics in the amazing <a href="http://bnachman.web.cern.ch/bnachman/index.html" target="_blank">Nachman group</a>.
Prior to Berkeley, I was fortunate to be part of the <a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program" target="_blank">Perimeter Scholars International</a> program, and studied at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd College</a>.</p>
<p>In a past life, I thought a lot about the foundations of quantum theory.
Although I&rsquo;m no longer pursuing a career in quantum foundations, I remain passionate about the field, and think that many important, recent ideas in quantum foundations are not being effectively communicated to a wider audience.
I hope this blog helps bridge that gap, and hope that my younger self from undergraduate years would have been inspired if she were to stumble upon such a blog.</p>
