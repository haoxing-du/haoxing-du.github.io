<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m <a href="/images/me.jpg"><strong>Haoxing</strong></a>.
I am a <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/in-continued-defense-of-effective" target="_blank">proud</a> <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/effective-altruism-an-introduction/" target="_blank">effective altruist</a> working in AI.
I currently work on predicting the weather with AI at <a href="https://windbornesystems.com/" target="_blank">WindBorne</a>, where I also get to <a href="https://windbornesystems.com/blog/flying-into-the-eye" target="_blank">play</a> with <a href="https://windbornesystems.com/blog/how-windbornes-self-flying-weather-balloons-navigate-the-sky-to-sense-the-globe" target="_blank">balloons</a>.
Previously, I worked on evaluating large language models for dangerous capabilities at <a href="https://metr.org" target="_blank">METR</a>, where we poked at the first AI agents before the term &ldquo;AI agent&rdquo; was invented.
I also did some <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FF8i6SLfKb4g7C4EL/inside-the-mind-of-a-superhuman-go-model-how-does-leela-zero-2" target="_blank">research</a> on neural network interpretability at <a href="https://www.redwoodresearch.org/" target="_blank">Redwood Research</a>.</p>
<p>Before getting into AI I studied theoretical physics.
At Berkeley, I did research in the intersection of machine learning and physics in the amazing <a href="https://nachmangroup.github.io/" target="_blank">Nachman group</a>.
Prior to Berkeley, I was fortunate to be part of the <a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program" target="_blank">Perimeter Scholars International</a> program, and had the privilege of spending the best college years possible at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd College</a>.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not thinking about technical topics, I like to read, play video games, make music, <a href="https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/pilots/detail:haoxing" target="_blank">fly</a> my paraglider, and make very slow progress hiking the <a href="https://ridgetrail.org/" target="_blank">Bay Area Ridge Trail</a>.</p>
<p>I am the happiest wife to <a href="https://www.kaseymarkel.com/" target="_blank">Kasey Markel</a>, and we live in the San Francisco Bay Area.
We have signed the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge" target="_blank">10% pledge 🔸</a>.
If you are reading this, please consider doing the same!</p>
<p>In a past life, I thought a lot about the foundations of quantum theory.
Although I&rsquo;m no longer pursuing a career in quantum foundations, I remain passionate about the field, and think that many important, recent ideas in quantum foundations are not being effectively communicated to a wider audience.
I hope the essays below help bridge that gap just a little.
I also hope that my younger self from undergraduate years would have been inspired if she were to stumble upon these.</p>
