    <div class="content"><p>Hi! I&rsquo;m <strong>Haoxing</strong>.
I&rsquo;m finishing up a master&rsquo;s in physics at UC Berkeley.
Nowadays, I think a lot about the <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/" target="_blank">best ways to do good</a>, and I&rsquo;m passionate about helping make sure that the artificial intelligence we develop is safe and beneficial.
Most recently, I participated in the second iteration of <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vvocfhQ7bcBR4FLBx/apply-to-the-second-ml-for-alignment-bootcamp-mlab-2-in" target="_blank">MLAB</a>, and did a <a href="https://github.com/haoxing-du/facts-in-llms" target="_blank">project</a> looking into how factual knowledge is represented in large language models.</p>
<p>While at Berkeley, I did research in the intersection of machine learning and physics in the amazing <a href="http://bnachman.web.cern.ch/bnachman/index.html" target="_blank">Nachman group</a>.
Prior to Berkeley, I was fortunate to be part of the <a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program" target="_blank">Perimeter Scholars International</a> program, and studied at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd College</a>.</p>
<p>In a past life, I thought a lot about the foundations of quantum theory.
Although I&rsquo;m no longer pursuing a career in quantum foundations, I remain passionate about the field, and think that many important, recent ideas in quantum foundations are not being effectively communicated to a wider audience.
I hope this blog helps bridge that gap, and hope that my younger self from undergraduate years would have been inspired if she were to stumble upon such a blog.</p>
