    <div class="content"><p>Hi! I&rsquo;m <strong>Haoxing</strong>.
I am a <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/in-continued-defense-of-effective" target="_blank">proud</a> <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/effective-altruism-an-introduction/" target="_blank">effective altruist</a>, and I&rsquo;m passionate about helping make sure that the artificial intelligence we develop is safe and beneficial.
I currently work on AI-based weather forecasting at <a href="https://windbornesystems.com/" target="_blank">WindBorne Systems</a>.
We have pretty cool <a href="https://windbornesystems.com/blog/how-windbornes-self-flying-weather-balloons-navigate-the-sky-to-sense-the-globe" target="_blank">balloons</a> too!
Previously, I worked on evaluating large language models for dangerous capabilities at <a href="https://metr.org" target="_blank">METR</a>, and did some research on neural network interpretability at <a href="https://www.redwoodresearch.org/" target="_blank">Redwood Research</a>.
Check out the work I did on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FF8i6SLfKb4g7C4EL/inside-the-mind-of-a-superhuman-go-model-how-does-leela-zero-2" target="_blank">interpreting Leela Zero</a>, a superhuman Go-playing neural network!</p>
<p>Before getting into AI I spent some years thinking about physics.
At Berkeley, I did research in the intersection of machine learning and physics in the amazing <a href="https://nachmangroup.github.io/" target="_blank">Nachman group</a>.
Prior to Berkeley, I was fortunate to be part of the <a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program" target="_blank">Perimeter Scholars International</a> program, and studied at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd College</a>.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not thinking about technical topics, I like to read, play video games, make music, dabble in agility with my dog Hope, and <a href="https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/pilots/detail:haoxing" target="_blank">fly</a> my paraglider.</p>
<p>In a past life, I thought a lot about the foundations of quantum theory.
Although I&rsquo;m no longer pursuing a career in quantum foundations, I remain passionate about the field, and think that many important, recent ideas in quantum foundations are not being effectively communicated to a wider audience.
I hope the essays below help bridge that gap just a little.
I also hope that my younger self from undergraduate years would have been inspired if she were to stumble upon these.</p>
