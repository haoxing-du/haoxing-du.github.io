Hi! I'm **Haoxing**. I'm a PhD student in theoretical physics at the University of California, Berkeley. 
Prior to Berkeley, I was fortunate to be part of the [Perimeter Scholars International](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program) program, and studied at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu).

This is a blog in which I attempt to write about topics in the foundations of quantum theory.
