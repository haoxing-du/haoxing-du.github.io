Hi! I'm **Haoxing**. 
I'm a PhD student in theoretical physics at the University of California, Berkeley.
My current research is at the intersection of machine learning and physics, with support from the amazing [Nachman group](http://bnachman.web.cern.ch/bnachman/index.html).
Prior to Berkeley, I was fortunate to be part of the [Perimeter Scholars International](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program) program, and studied at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu).

Although I'm no longer pursuing a career in quantum foundations, I remain passionate about the field, and think that the important, recent ideas in quantum foundations are not being effectively communicated to a wider audience.
I hope this blog helps bridge that gap, and hope that my younger self from undergraduate years would have been inspired if she were to stumble upon such a blog.
