Hi! I'm **Haoxing**. 
I think a lot about the [best ways to do good](https://80000hours.org/podcast/effective-altruism-an-introduction/), and I'm passionate about helping make sure that the artificial intelligence we develop is safe and beneficial. 
Currently, I work on evaluating the capabilities of language models with the [Evals team](https://evals.alignment.org) at the [Alignment Research Center](https://alignment.org). 
Before this I did some research on neural network interpretability at [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/). 
Check out the work I did on [interpreting Leela Zero](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FF8i6SLfKb4g7C4EL/inside-the-mind-of-a-superhuman-go-model-how-does-leela-zero-2), a superhuman Go-playing neural network.

Before getting involved in AI safety I spent some years thinking about physics. 
At Berkeley, I did research in the intersection of machine learning and physics in the amazing [Nachman group](http://bnachman.web.cern.ch/bnachman/index.html).
Prior to Berkeley, I was fortunate to be part of the [Perimeter Scholars International](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program) program, and studied at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu).
 
In a past life, I thought a lot about the foundations of quantum theory.
Although I'm no longer pursuing a career in quantum foundations, I remain passionate about the field, and think that many important, recent ideas in quantum foundations are not being effectively communicated to a wider audience.
I hope this blog helps bridge that gap, and hope that my younger self from undergraduate years would have been inspired if she were to stumble upon such a blog.
