Hi! I'm **Haoxing**. 
I'm finishing up a master's in physics at UC Berkeley.
Nowadays, I think a lot about the [best ways to do good](https://80000hours.org/podcast/effective-altruism-an-introduction/), and I'm passionate about helping make sure that the artificial intelligence we develop is safe and beneficial. I'm doing some research on neural network interpretability at [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/). Check out this [website](https://modelbehavior.ngrok.io/) I made for playing with GPT-2 and [finding algorithmic behaviors](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LkBmAGJgZX2tbwGKg/help-out-redwood-research-s-interpretability-team-by-finding) in it.

While at Berkeley, I did research in the intersection of machine learning and physics in the amazing [Nachman group](http://bnachman.web.cern.ch/bnachman/index.html).
Prior to Berkeley, I was fortunate to be part of the [Perimeter Scholars International](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program) program, and studied at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu).
 
In a past life, I thought a lot about the foundations of quantum theory.
Although I'm no longer pursuing a career in quantum foundations, I remain passionate about the field, and think that many important, recent ideas in quantum foundations are not being effectively communicated to a wider audience.
I hope this blog helps bridge that gap, and hope that my younger self from undergraduate years would have been inspired if she were to stumble upon such a blog.
