Hi! I'm **Haoxing**.
I am a [proud](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/in-continued-defense-of-effective) [effective altruist](https://80000hours.org/podcast/effective-altruism-an-introduction/) and I work in AI.
I currently work on AI-based weather forecasting at [WindBorne](https://windbornesystems.com/).
We have pretty cool [balloons](https://windbornesystems.com/blog/how-windbornes-self-flying-weather-balloons-navigate-the-sky-to-sense-the-globe) too!
Previously, I worked on evaluating large language models for dangerous capabilities at [METR](https://metr.org), and did some research on neural network interpretability at [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/). 
Check out the work I did on [interpreting Leela Zero](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FF8i6SLfKb4g7C4EL/inside-the-mind-of-a-superhuman-go-model-how-does-leela-zero-2), a superhuman Go-playing neural network!

Before getting into AI I spent some years thinking about physics.
At Berkeley, I did research in the intersection of machine learning and physics in the amazing [Nachman group](https://nachmangroup.github.io/).
Prior to Berkeley, I was fortunate to be part of the [Perimeter Scholars International](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program) program, and studied at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu).

When I'm not thinking about technical topics, I like to read, play video games, make music, and [fly](https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/pilots/detail:haoxing) my paraglider.
 
In a past life, I thought a lot about the foundations of quantum theory.
Although I'm no longer pursuing a career in quantum foundations, I remain passionate about the field, and think that many important, recent ideas in quantum foundations are not being effectively communicated to a wider audience.
I hope the essays below help bridge that gap just a little. 
I also hope that my younger self from undergraduate years would have been inspired if she were to stumble upon these.
