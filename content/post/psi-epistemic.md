## A category mistake

On the early morning of September 14, 1822, a young Frenchman named Jean-Francois Champollion was running through the streets of Paris. He bursted into his brother's office at the Académie des Inscriptions, and shouted, "Je tiens mon affaire!" ("I've done it!"), before collapsing on the floor. Champollion had just become the first person able to read ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs in two thousand years. 

Following the sleepless nights that led to this historic achievement, Champollion would immediately succumb to a week-long, exhaustion-induced illness, and the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs would go down in history as one of the best examples that demonstrate how simple, incorrect assumptions can drastically hinder scientific progress. In this particular case, the roadblock amounted to one simple assumption about the nature of the hieroglyphs, what *type* of objects they are---a category mistake. For generations, scholars studying the script believed that the hieroglyphs are *ideographic*, meaning that they are symbols that represent ideas. However, as Champollion had eventually figured out, this was a false premise. Much of the Egyptian hieroglyphic script is in fact *phonetic*, with symbols representing sounds.

How did the belief that the hieroglyphs were ideographic come into being in the first place? Efforts to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs started not long after the Ancient Egyptian scripts ceased to be understood in the fourth century BC. Rather unfortunately, pretty much all scholars who worked on the decipherment had assumed that the hieroglyphs are ideographic from the get go, perhaps due to their extremely visually suggestive nature. The result of such an assumption was a stall in progress for essentially a millennium. No matter how hard people tried, they could not figure out what ideas corresponded to which hieroglyphs. And this was not due to a lack of imagination. In his treatise on the subject, [*Hieroglyphica*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Hieroglyphics_of_Horapollo_Nilous/9boHVUTq_vEC?hl=en&gbpv=0), Ancient Greek scholar Horapollo showcased his extraordinary imagination in his theory for the meaning of 189 hieroglyphs. For example, let's take a look at these three symbols:

<center>
<img src="/images/psi-epi/goose.png" alt="goose" width="100"/>
<img src="/images/psi-epi/ibis.png" alt="ibis" width="100"/>
<img src="/images/psi-epi/swallow.png" alt="swallow" width="100"/>
</center>

According to Horapollo, the first of these hieroglyphs means "son", represented as a goose. This is because---reasons Horapollo---the goose is excessively fond of its offspring, and routinely sacrifice their own lives to preserve those of its young. The second bird is an ibis, and according to Horapollo denotes "heart", both because it resembles the shape of a heart (does it?) and that the ibis is "consecrated to Hermes [Thoth], the lord of every heart and of reasoning". The third bird is a swallow, and represents "the whole of a parent's substance has been left to the sons". This is because "[a swallow] rolls herself in the mud, and builds a nest for her young, when she is herself about to die".

Now, the first of these interpretations is actually known to be correct---Horapollo lived fairly close in time to people who knew the hieroglyphs, and it looks like some genuise knowledge about the script was retained. But it is not for the reasons that Horapollo thought. Instead, the goose symbol represents the syllable "sꜣ", which is the pronunciation of the word for "son" in the spoken language of Ancient Egyptians. [^determinative] Needless to say, most of his interpretation are now proven to be complete nonsense. Nevertheless, the harm was done. Even though some of these interpretations are so wildly speculative that they probably were never taken as true, scholars pursuing the decipherment of the hieroglyphs following Horapollo's footsteps internalized the premise that the hieroglyphs are ideographic.

[^determinative]: It turns out that even the little rectangular box is relevant. It is a vertical stroke that denotes a "determinative", which serves to distinguish it from other words that are pronounced "sꜣ".

As a result, it was not until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone that real progress started being made. The Rosetta Stone, discovered by Napoleon’s army in 1799, bears the exact same passage of text in three different scripts: hieroglyphs on top, Ancient Greek at the bottem, and an unidentified script (later to be deemed Demotic, a different type of Ancient Egyptian script) in the middle. Since Ancient Greek was still a known language, this enabled a direct side-by-side comparison of the languages. It’s basically as close as we could hope to get to a textbook. 

Even then, the hieroglyphs were not deciphered right away. Soon after the discovery of the Stone, scholars such as Thomas Young had correctly figured out that the parts of the text that were enclosed in little ovals, named “cartouches”, correspond to names of Egyptian kings. Building upon the work of Young and others, our hero Champollion was able to deduce that the cartouches below spelled the names "Ptolemy" and "Cleopatra", and he was able to identify the phonetic values of the hieroglyphs by comparing the two names.

<center>
<img src="/images/psi-epi/ptolemy.jpeg" alt="ptolemy" width="300"/>
<img src="/images/psi-epi/cleopatra.jpeg" alt="cleopatra" width="500"/>
<img src="/images/psi-epi/phonetic.jpeg" alt="phonetic" width="500"/>
</center>

However, even then, Champollion did not go on and decipher the rest of the script right away. The idea that the hieroglyphs were ideographic was so entrenched in his mind that he thought only names of foreign origin were spelled out phonetically, as were Ptolemy and Cleopatra. It was not after many more months of effort without progress did Champollion finally start to entertain the idea that perhaps glyphs can be phonetic outside of cartouches. As soon as he started looking at the text with this new assumption, he immediately started to recognize familiar phonetic elements from a language that was still used then that he was familiar with, Coptic. [^coptic] This was it. It turns out that the Egyptian hieroglyphs are essentially another alphabet for the spoken language of Coptic, and Champollion would land on the floor of his brother’s office a few days later. [^story]

[^coptic]: This is somewhat of a lucky coincidence, actually. By the 19th century, [Coptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language) was no longer in use other than as the liturgical language of the Coptic Church. Champollion had studied Coptic because of his fascination with ancient Egypt and the connection of Coptic to various ancient Egyptian languages.

[^story]: This was, of course, also a dramaticized version of the story of how the hieroglyphs were deciphered. The whole script was definitely not deciphered by Champollion alone in one day, and involved a lot more effort by many people for many more years. For a more detailed account of the decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, see this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decipherment_of_ancient_Egyptian_scripts) page.



##  $\psi$-onticity: another category mistake?

I love the story of the decipherment of the hieroglyphs, and what it teaches us about how bafflingly costly a category mistake can be. Of course, I’d better start talking about the foundations of quantum theory before you start wondering what happened to this blog and stop reading. The reason why I’m bringing up the tale of deciphering hieroglyphs---besides that I really love good stories---is because I want to ask the following question: **Could the reason why we have been stuck on the interpretation of quantum theory that we are making a similar category mistake?** By assuming that the hieroglyphs are ideograms, scholars were stumped for a millennium, while the spoken language of Coptic was being passed on from generation to generation. What could be a possible incorrect assumption that we have been making in the interpretation of quantum theory?

Before I discuss the candidate assumption that I have in mind, I need to first define a very important distinction: ontic versus epistemic. Loosely speaking, something is *ontic* if it is real, or corresponds to an element of reality, and something is *epistemic* if it corresponds to the knowledge possessed by some agent. While this is by no means a clear distinction, and it can sometimes be tricky to judge whether something is ontic or epistemic, a simple puzzle comes in handy to illustrate this distinction:


You move to a new town to start a new job. On your new daily commute, you drive by this billboard every day, but unfortunately the display seems to be broken. How would you go about figuring out what the billboard is supposed to say?

<center>
<img src="/images/psi-epi/billboard.jpeg" alt="billboard" width="450"/>
</center>

The numbers on the billboard change every day, so you suspect that the numbers have to do with weather. Enjoying a little challenge, you decide to conduct your own experiments to figure out the meaning of the numbers. You go and buy a thermometer (or use a clever contraption of your own device, if you prefer), and see that the highest temperature of the whole day is 18 degrees Celsius when the first entry on the billboard says 18. Aha! Similarly, you measure the wind speed, and realize that the second entry says 19 when the wind speed, averaged over the whole day, is about 19 kilometers per hour. The third one takes you a bit longer to figure out. Eventually you decide to take a bunch of pictures of the local sky, and you find that the billboard says 35% when 35% of the sky is covered by clouds on average. [^cloud] You are a bit stumped by the fourth one, though. You keep measuring more and more weather-related quantities, but you can't seem to find anything that is 40% when the billboard says 40%.

[^cloud]: "Average cloud cover" is a field reported by the weather app that I use. I didn't know it is a thing either!

Eventually, after many weeks of effort, (thankfully, everything takes forever to fix so you get to continue carrying out your investigation), you sit down to tally up all the data you have collected so far. You realize that out of all the days that the billboard said 40% for the last entry, it rained on about 40% of them! Similarly, out of all the days that the billboard said 80%, it rained about 80% of the time, and so on. You have now solved the puzzle: the last number on the billboard is the probability of rain.

In this little puzzle, the first three quantities reported on the billboard are _ontic_, and you were able to figure out what they corresponded to by measuring aspects of the weather (i.e. elements of reality). The probability of rain was much harder for you to figure out, because it is an _epistemic_ quantity---something of a completely different nature. It is the weather forecaster's belief (perhaps an unrealistically accurate one) about the weather. There is nothing in the real world that is 40% when the probability of rain is reported as 40%.

With this distinction between ontic and epistemic things, we are now ready to ask: is the quantum state ontic or epistemic?

Among the existing interpretations of quantum theory, it sure looks like the $\psi$-ontic view is dominant. In fact, a number of interpretations take the $\psi$-*complete* position, which is that the quantum state alone is a complete description of reality. Interpretations taking this position include the [many worlds interpretation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/), which is the subject of my last [blog post](http://www.haoxingdu.com/post/mw/). Perhaps more prominently, this is also the position endorsed by the "orthodox" interpretation that is presented in many textbooks on quantum mechanics. Some textbooks straight up teach it as an axiom of quantum mechanics, such as John Preskill's [lecture notes](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/chap2_15.pdf) on quantum information:
> **Axiom 1. States.** A state is a complete description of a physical system. In quantum mechanics, a state is a ray in a Hilbert space. 

$\psi$-onticity is a weaker notion than $\psi$-completeness. Hidden variable theories, which posit additional variables that make up the description of reality, often give the quantum state an ontic status. One prominent example of this type of theories is [Bohmian mechanics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/). In Bohmian mechanics, the ontology is posited to be the quantum state, together with some additional variables that are the positions of the particle. Most other ontological models for quantum theory that have been studied to date also regard the quantum state as ontic.

[^comment]: At face value, this does not seem to tell us whether the quantum state is ontic or epistemic. However, with one extra logical step, we see that this means that the quantum state must be ontic: if the quantum state were epistemic, then it must be possible for two different quantum states to describe the same state of reality. But if the quantum state is a "complete description of a physical system", then different quantum states must correspond to different realities.

Given this, it might appear that the ontic status of the quantum state is the overwhelming consensus, and the answer to our question is clear. But is there really any evidence that the quantum state is ontic? Could $\psi$-onticity be just like the plausible but ultimately incorrect assumption that the Egyptian hieroglyphs are ideographic? Below, I argue that $\psi$-onticity might be a problematic premise that has been widely internalized without good reasons. I will make this case from two angles: first, why $\psi$-onticity is problematic from the standpoint of locality, and second, why there appears to be strong evidence for the epistemic nature of the quantum state.

## Locality

The tension between $\psi$-onticity and locality is not at all subtle, and arguments pointing out this conflict have a long history. Einstein is perhaps the first and most prominent figure to make this point. It is well-known that Einstein was troubled by the $\psi$-complete position, and it is widely accepted that he had attempted to construct a hidden variable model of his own. [This article](https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2661) analyzes various arguments by Einstein, and argues that he not only argued against $\psi$-completeness, but in fact favored a $\psi$-epistemic interpretation.

Regardless of history, the simplest way to see this tension is through the phenomenon of steering. Suppose that Alice and Bob shared a pair of qubits (say, the spin of some particle) in the maximally entangled state, $$\ket{\psi^-} = \frac{\ket{\uparrow}\ket{\downarrow} - \ket{\downarrow}\ket{\uparrow}}{\sqrt{2}}.$$ Quantum theory predicts the following: If Alice measures her qubit in the {$\ket{\uparrow}, \ket{\downarrow}$} basis, then she would get outcome $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ with 50-50 probability. If she gets outcome $\uparrow$, then the quantum state of her qubit is immediately updated to $\ket{\uparrow}$, and the quantum state of Bob's qubit is immediately updated to $\ket{\downarrow}$, and that means that Bob is guaranteed to get the outcome $\downarrow$ if he measures his qubit in the $\{ \ket{\uparrow}, \ket{\downarrow} \}$ basis. Suppose that Alice instead chooses to measure her qubit in another basis, say, the basis {$\ket{+\hat{n}}, \ket{-\hat{n}}$}, where $\ket{+\hat{n}}$ points angle $\theta$ away from the $\uparrow$ direction, and $\ket{-\hat{n}}$ points the opposite direction from $\ket{+\hat{n}}$. Now, she would still get outcome $+\hat{n}$ and $-\hat{n}$ with 50-50 odds, and if she got outcome $+\hat{n}$, that would update the quantum state of her qubit to $\ket{+\hat{n}}$, and that of Bob's qubit to $\ket{-\hat{n}}$, guaranteeing that he gets the $-\hat{n}$ outcome when measuring his qubit in the same basis. In other words, Alice and Bob would always find their spins in opposite directions.

Now, the above analysis holds no matter how far apart Alice and Bob are separated. Quantum theory predicts that Alice's measurement on her qubit *instantaneously* changes the state of Bob's qubit, even when they are on opposite sides of the galaxy. In particular, by choosing to measure her qubit in the {$\ket{\uparrow}, \ket{\downarrow}$} basis, Alice can make Bob's qubit to be in either state $\ket{\uparrow}$ or state $\ket{\downarrow}$, whereas by measuring her qubit in the {$\ket{+\hat{n}}, \ket{-\hat{n}}$} basis, she makes Bob's qubit be in one of $\ket{+\hat{n}}$ and $\ket{-\hat{n}}$ instead. This is already very problematic if one believes that the quantum state is a state of reality---this means that Alice's action can instantaneously influence the reality lightyears away. This phenomenon is precisely what Einstein termed "spooky action at a distance" [^saad].

[^saad]: Note that the usual analysis in a quantum mechanics textbook is that despite 


## Spekkens toy model

What is your favorite quantum phenomenon? Entanglement? The existence of a teleportation protocol? How about the weirdest, "quantumest" quantum phenomenon? Non-commutativity of measurements? Interference? The no-cloning theorem?

Now, suppose that there is a theory that contains all of the above "quantum" phenomena, plus maybe a dozen more. Let's call this theory Theory X. It is clear that Theory X is different from quantum theory. It really looks like it is just a tad "less quantum" than quantum theory itself, in the sense that Theory X contains a long list of phenomena that feature in quantum theory that do not appear in classical theories, while failing to reproduce only a few quantum phenomena. It essentially sorts quantum phenomenology into a "weakly nonclassical" and a "strongly nonclassical" bucket, by the following table:

[Table ]

Presented with such a theory, any quantum-foundations-enthusiast must be thrilled. Since Theory X reproduces so many features that are regarded as quantum, Theory X must be very similar to quantum theory in certain aspects. It must capture the essence of quantum theory in some sense. One must take Theory X seriously and ask what are the lessons we might learn from it about the interpretation of quantum theory. We should teach it to every undergrad learning quantum mechanics for the first time, to really make clear which aspects of quantum theory are quintessentially quantum. [^undergrad]

[^undergrad]: Of course, we currently do no such thing. Instead, undergrads learn quotes such as the one from [Feynman](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html) on how interference phenomena "contains the _only_ mystery [of quantum mechanics]", when it is clear how interference can be [understood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13727) in a framework similar to the one discussed here. Or worse, we teach undergrad physics majors that there is nothing left to be figured out in the foundations of quantum mechanics, and we just need to Shut Up And Calculate.

In this blog post, I present to you Theory X, more commonly referred to as [Spekkens' toy theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401052). The core idea behind the theory is simply imposing a fundamental limit on the amount of knowledge any agent can have about a system, and consider the behavior of states corresponding to the knowledge of such agents. I will argue that the unequivocal lesson that we must learn from Spekkens' toy theory is that, the best way to understand a large domain of quantum phenomenology is to understand it as a theory of information. To me, the existence of such a toy theory is an unequivocal piece of evidence showing that the quantum state is a state of knowledge, rather than a state of reality.

## Concluding thoughts

Bell

All this to say, it is not that I think the $\psi$-epistemic position must be correct. From a rational perspective, it is just surprising how essentially all interpretational effort has been put into the $\psi$-ontic basket, whereas there is very good evidence that the $\psi$-epistemic approach is worth investigating, and possibly has more potential. I also think that now any satisfactory interpretation of quantum theory, especially ones that take the $\psi$-ontic approach, must pass the bar of explaining why the quantum state behaves so much like a state of knowledge.
