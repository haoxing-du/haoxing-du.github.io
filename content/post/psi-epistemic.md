What is your favorite quantum phenomenon? Entanglement? The existence of a teleportation protocol? How about the weirdest, "quantumest" quantum phenomenon? Non-commutativity of measurements? Interference? The no-cloning theorem?

Now, suppose that there is a theory distinct from quantum theory that contains all of the above "quantum" phenomena, plus maybe a dozen more. Let's call this theory Theory X. It really looks like it is just a tad "less quantum" than quantum theory itself, in the sense that Theory X contains a long list of phenomena that feature in quantum theory that do not appear in classical theories, while failing to reproduce only a few quantum phenomena. It essentially sorts quantum phenomenology into a "weakly nonclassical" and a "strongly nonclassical" bucket, by the following table:

[Table ]

Presented with such a theory, any quantum-foundations-enthusiast must be thrilled. Since Theory X reproduces so many features that are regarded as quantum, Theory X must be very similar to quantum theory in certain aspects. It must capture the essence of quantum theory in some sense. One must take Theory X seriously and ask what are the lessons we might learn from it about the interpretation of quantum theory. We should teach it to every undergrad learning quantum mechanics for the first time, to really make clear which aspects of quantum theory are quintessentially quantum. [^undergrad]

[^undergrad]: Of course, we currently do no such thing. Instead, undergrads learn quotes such as the one from [Feynman](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html) on how interference phenomena "contains the _only_ mystery [of quantum mechanics]", when it is clear how interference can be [understood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13727) in a framework similar to the one discussed here. Or worse, we teach undergrad physics majors that there is nothing left to be figured out in the foundations of quantum mechanics, and we just need to Shut Up And Calculate.

In this blog post, I present to you Theory X, more commonly referred to as [Spekkens' toy theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401052). The core idea behind the theory is simply imposing a fundamental limit on the amount of knowledge any agent can have about a system, and consider the behavior of states corresponding to the knowledge of such agents. I will argue that the unequivocal lesson that we must learn from Spekkens' toy theory is that, the best way to understand a large domain of quantum phenomenology is to understand it as a theory of information. To me, the existence of such a toy theory is an unequivocal piece of evidence showing that the quantum state is a state of knowledge, rather than a state of reality.

Einstein was probably the first advocate for this position.
