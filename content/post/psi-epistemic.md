## A category mistake: decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphs

One early morning of xxx, 19xx, a young Frenchman named Jean-xx Champollion was running through the streets of xxx. He bursted into the blacksmith workshop run by his brother, and shouted, “xxx!”, before collapsing on the floor. Champollion had just become the first person able to read ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs in more than x hundred years. Following this historic achievement, Champollion would immediately succumb to exhaustion from staying up many nights in a row, and the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs would go down in history as one of the best examples that demonstrate how simple, incorrect assumptions can drastically hinder scientific progress. In this particular case, the roadblock amounts to one simple assumption about the nature of the glyphs, what __type__ of object that are—a category mistake. As Champollion had eventually figured out, Egyptian hieroglyphs are phonograms, instead of ideograms—meaning that they are symbols that stand for different sounds instead of symbols that directly correspond to meaning—whereas generations of scholars before him that assumed otherwise.

There has been numerous effort dedicated to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs pretty much immediately after they went extinct in xxx AD. Rather unfortunately, pretty much all of them had assumed that the glyphs are ideograms from the get go, perhaps due to their extremely visually suggestive nature. The result of such an assumption was a stall in progress for essentially a millennium. No matter how hard people tried, they could not figure out what meanings correspond to which glyphs. And this was not due to a lack of imagination. In his treatise on the subject, xxx, Ancient Greek scholar xxx showcased his extraordinary (and perhaps over the board) imagination in his theory for the meaning of many glyphs, including the ones pictured below. I don’t know about you, but I think it’s really neat that a language would have a symbol that means “a man who has been succeeded in his property by a son whom he hated”. Some scholars pursuing the ideographic decipherment of the glyphs even gradually became convinced that the script is not entirely the product of man, and instead stood for some sort of sacred instructions from higher beings.

[glyphs]

It was not until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone that real progress started being made. The Rosetta Stone, discovered by Napoleon’s army in xxx, bears the exact same passage of text in three different scripts: Ancient Greek, xxx, and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Since Ancient Greek was still a known language, this enabled a direct side-by-side comparison of the languages. It’s basically as close as we could hope to get to a textbook. Even then, the glyphs were not deciphered right away. Soon after the discovery of the Stone, Champollion figured out that the parts of the text that were enclosed in little ovals—named “cartouches”, French for “bullets”—correspond to names of Pharaohs. He was confident that the cartouches pictured below corresponded to Pharaohs xxx and Cleopatra. From here, it is easy to see that the glyphs that appear in both names correspond to certain syllables that are repeated, e.g. . In other words, it looks like the glyphs are phonograms! However, this was not the end of the story. Champollion, just like generations of scholars before him, was so attached to the idea that the glyphs are ideograms, that he proposed that the glyphs only function as phonograms when appearing in cartouches, and are still ideograms elsewhere.

[cartouches]

It was not after many more months of effort without progress did Champollion finally start to entertain the idea that perhaps glyphs can be phonograms outside of cartouches. As soon as he started looking at the text with this new assumption, he immediately started to recognize familiar phonographic elements from a language that was still used today and he was familiar with, Coptic. This was it. It turns out that the Egyptian hieroglyphs are essentially another alphabet for the spoken language of Coptic, and Champollion would land on the floor of his brother’s shop a few days later.

I love the story of the decipherment of the hieroglyphs, and what it teaches us about how bafflingly costly a category mistake can be. 


##  Psi-onticity: another category mistake?

Of course, I’d better start talking about the foundations of quantum theory before you start wondering what has happened to this blog and stop reading. The reason why I’m bringing up the tale of deciphering hieroglyphs—besides that I really love good stories—is because I want to ask the following question: Could the reason why we have been stuck on the interpretation of quantum theory that we are making a similar category mistake? By assuming that the glyphs are ideograms, scholars were stumped for a millennium, while the spoken language of Coptic was being passed on generations to generations. What could be a possible incorrect assumption that we have been making in the interpretation of quantum theory?

Before I discuss the candidate assumption that I have in mind, I need to first define a very important distinction: ontic versus epistemic. Loosely speaking, a certain quantity is __ontic__ if it corresponds to an element of reality, and a certain quantity is __epistemic__ if is correspond to the knowledge possessed by some agent. This is by no means a clear distinction, and can in fact be tricky when applied, but a simple example comes in handy: imagine an advanced alien civilization has contacted Earth, and invited you on a tour of one of their largest cities, Oykot. (The original example in Rob’s lecture uses Japanese, but I suspect many readers of this blog will know how to read Japanese or Chinese already and make the example uninteresting, so bear with me with a bit of silliness.) Walking down the streets of Oykot everyday, you see a billboard as below, with the numbers slightly changing day to day.

[billboard]

How would you go about figuring out what the billboard is saying? Given the changing numbers and the similarity you observe between Earthling’s culture and the aliens’, you suspect that the numbers have to do with weather. As a representative of the intelligent human species, you decide to conduct your own experiments to figure out the meaning of the numbers. You go and buy a thermometer (or use a clever contraption of your own device, if you prefer), and see that it reads 23 degrees Celsius when the first entry on the billboard says 23. Aha! Similarly, you measure the wind speed of 

## Spekkens toy model

What is your favorite quantum phenomenon? Entanglement? The existence of a teleportation protocol? How about the weirdest, "quantumest" quantum phenomenon? Non-commutativity of measurements? Interference? The no-cloning theorem?

Now, suppose that there is a theory that contains all of the above "quantum" phenomena, plus maybe a dozen more. Let's call this theory Theory X. It is clear that Theory X is different from quantum theory. It really looks like it is just a tad "less quantum" than quantum theory itself, in the sense that Theory X contains a long list of phenomena that feature in quantum theory that do not appear in classical theories, while failing to reproduce only a few quantum phenomena. It essentially sorts quantum phenomenology into a "weakly nonclassical" and a "strongly nonclassical" bucket, by the following table:

[Table ]

Presented with such a theory, any quantum-foundations-enthusiast must be thrilled. Since Theory X reproduces so many features that are regarded as quantum, Theory X must be very similar to quantum theory in certain aspects. It must capture the essence of quantum theory in some sense. One must take Theory X seriously and ask what are the lessons we might learn from it about the interpretation of quantum theory. We should teach it to every undergrad learning quantum mechanics for the first time, to really make clear which aspects of quantum theory are quintessentially quantum. [^undergrad]

[^undergrad]: Of course, we currently do no such thing. Instead, undergrads learn quotes such as the one from [Feynman](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html) on how interference phenomena "contains the _only_ mystery [of quantum mechanics]", when it is clear how interference can be [understood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13727) in a framework similar to the one discussed here. Or worse, we teach undergrad physics majors that there is nothing left to be figured out in the foundations of quantum mechanics, and we just need to Shut Up And Calculate.

In this blog post, I present to you Theory X, more commonly referred to as [Spekkens' toy theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401052). The core idea behind the theory is simply imposing a fundamental limit on the amount of knowledge any agent can have about a system, and consider the behavior of states corresponding to the knowledge of such agents. I will argue that the unequivocal lesson that we must learn from Spekkens' toy theory is that, the best way to understand a large domain of quantum phenomenology is to understand it as a theory of information. To me, the existence of such a toy theory is an unequivocal piece of evidence showing that the quantum state is a state of knowledge, rather than a state of reality.

Einstein was probably the first advocate for this position.
