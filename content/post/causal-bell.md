A few months ago, I attended an unusual workshop at the Simons Institute at UC Berkeley, titled “Quantum physics and statistical causal models”. Half the people in attendance were statisticians working in causal inference, and the other half are physicists thinking about quantum foundations. The two communities were not just there in the same room by coincidence, or as an excuse to enjoy the beautiful California spring weather. They were brought together by a line of recent research that takes tools from causal modeling and apply them towards the understanding of Bell’s theorem and nonlocality. In my view, this is the most modern and clearest analysis of the meaning of Bell’s theorem, and yet seems hitherto(?) unknown in popular media. In this blog post, I will try to explain how to understand Bell’s theorem from a causal perspective, aka why Tim Maudlin and xxx ended up in the same room at Simons.

But before going into the causal modeling world, let us start with a more old-school presentation of Bell’s theorem. Unlike the causality connection, Bell's theorem _has_ been extensively written about in the popular science media, and here are [some] [presentations] that are also very good.

## The CHSH game

It is incredible to me how many students in physics finish their undergraduate degrees without having learned about, or even heard of Bell’s theorem. Or perhaps I shouldn’t be that surprised, given that the interpretational stance towards quantum theory of most physics curricula is “don’t worry about it”, and Bell’s theorem certainly has the potential of pushing young curious minds down the rabbit hole of quantum foundations... But there are really no excuses, because it is so simple to explain Bell's theorem and nonlocality in its basic form.

The simplest presentation that I know of Bell's theorem is in the language of a game, the CHSH game [^CHSH]. It is a game not in the sense that it is fun to play. (Although, if you want to play it for fun with a friend, be my guest!) It is a _game_, because there is a set of rules that the players stick to, and an objective that they are trying to optimize towards. There are two players in a CHSH game, say, Alice and Bob. They each take a binary input, and give a binary output.have a fair coin that they could flip, and 

[^CHSH]: CHSH are the initials of four people, ...


## Conclusion

I get the question a lot: What is exactly the field of quantum foundations? I don’t blame folks for asking questions such as this, and I think I can see the image that they picture in their head what quantum foundations is—a bunch of old dude physicists philosophizing and bickering about their pet interpretations. But precisely because of tools such as causal modeling, it is what the field of modern quantum foundations is not. I haven’t gotten very good at expressing this with a few sentences yet—as you see, I have quite a few thoughts on this subject… But from now on, I will be able to point folks to this post
