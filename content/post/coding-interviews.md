Iâ€™m needing to study for coding interviews, and am not feeling a whole lot of motivation for doing so. I thought it might help to write down notes as I do so; I sure find it a lot more motivating!

# BFS
As I learned from a friend who has an interview-prep startup, BFS is the most important topic in coding interviews these days. It is just everywhere! BFS stands for breadth-first search, which is a very useful search algorithm. The name is pretty self-explanatory. It has a cousin named depth-first search (DFS) that is also pretty useful.

Here is how it usually goes:

from collections import deque



## Bellman-Ford (shortest path)

# Concurrency

Bitwise AND always results in a number no greater than the smaller of the arguments.

# Individual Problems
787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
Instead tracking visited, track best price to a given city found so far

100. Same Tree
1609. Even Odd Tree
977. Squares of a Sorted Array
